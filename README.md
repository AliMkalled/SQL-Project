# Introduction
Dive into the data job market! Focusing on data analyst roles, this project explores top-paying jobs, in-demand skills, and where high demand meets high salary in data analytics.

# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpont top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

Data hails from [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.
# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL**: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking. 
# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. 
Here's how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on jobs in Canada. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field. 

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location LIKE '%Canada%' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **Salary Range:** Top 10 paing data analyst roles span from $100,500 to $111,175, indicating significant salary potential in the field.
- **Diverse Employers:** Companies like Stripe, SunLife, and HoYoverse are among those offering high salaries, showing a broad interest across different industries.
- **Job Title Variety:** There's a high diversity in job titles, from Data Analyst to Analytics Engineering Lead, reflecing varied roles and specializations within data analytics.

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS(
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location LIKE '%Canada%' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY 
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
```
Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for the top 10 highest paying data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **SQL** is leading with a bold count of 7.

### 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts
This query helped identify the skills most frequently requested in job postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.

```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_location LIKE '%Canada%'
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC
limit 5
```
Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for data analysts in 2023:
- **SQL** and **Excel** remain fundamental, emphasizing the need for strong foundational skills in data processing and spreadsheet manipulation.
- **Programming** and **Visualization Tools** like **Python**, **Tableau**, and **Power BI** are essential, pointing towards the increasing importance of technical skills in data storytelling and decision support.
